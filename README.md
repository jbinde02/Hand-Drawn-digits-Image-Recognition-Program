# Hand-Drawn-digits-Image-Recognition-Program
Small application made for class project. Uses Python3 and SKLearn to train a ML model that is used for predicting hand drawn digits 0-9.

## Usage
Download the Python script, the pickle file, and the folder of premade hand drawn digits.
Then simply run the script.
The pickle file is a serialized form of the trained model so it doesn't have to create a new one each time it runs.

## Roadmap
I would like to continue working on this program. Some items include...
* Use SKLearn preproccessing methods for increasing accuracy
* Ability to load own images to create a new model
* Selecting a model the program will use
* Inputing images one at a time
