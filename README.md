# Hand-Drawn-digits-Image-Recognition-Program
Small application made for class project and later expanded on. Uses Python and SKLearn to train a ML model that is used for predicting hand drawn digits 0-9.

## Techologies
The script is written in Python and we make use of multiple libraries listed in requirements.txt

Libraries used include
* numpy - Arrays
* matplotlib - Graphing
* Pillow - Image processing
* scikit-learn - ML model

## Usage
(Download and extract) or clone this repository to your device. Install the required libraries in requirements.txt using a package installer such as Pip.

Run the script. When no arguments are provided it will automatically run the help command. The usable commands will be printed out. Interacting with the program is done through command line arguments and UI elements

## Roadmap
I would like to continue working on this program. Some items include...
* Use SKLearn preproccessing methods for increasing accuracy
* ~~Ability to load own images to create a new model~~
* ~~Selecting a model the program will use~~
* ~~Inputing images one at a time~~
* Ability to draw images in the UI instead of always having to select a image file
